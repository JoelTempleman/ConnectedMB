# MB_School_Backbone

This is a spin off project from https://github.com/cybera/connectin-infra and https://github.com/cybera/connectin

In this version, the target locations of the data collection will be the approx 700 Public Schools in Manitoba (or as many as access and funding will permit). Collecting Ping, Speed, and Uptime for each location will provide a baseline for Broadband Internet connectivity. This baseline will identify the feasability of adapting more EdTech in a given location.
