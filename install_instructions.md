# This project is intended as a learning project covering several topics. Each part can be auto-installed by following the direction and running the scripts, 
# or the phases can be broken down and each step explored and explained.

# The general phases are: 

Preparing the equipment: 1) Test server; and 2) One or more remote clients.

Flashing the base OS: The server and client will need a base operating system installed.

Creating a test network: To isolate this network from the local network, a router will be setup.

Create a Git Hub account: To "fork" (copy) the existing project and explore software version control.

Install: To install the project software on the server which will also act as a repository for the client software.

Docker up: Start the multiple virtual servers.

Install: To install the project software on the remote clients.

Test and modify: Under perfect conditions, the clients will collect data and send it to the server. Troubleshooting and corrections may be required.

Data analysis: Using the software Jupyter, the collected data can be reviewed and used to show desired information.
